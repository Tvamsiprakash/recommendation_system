# üöÄ E-commerce Recommender System

A full-stack e-commerce application with a robust **hybrid recommendation engine**. This project demonstrates a complete development workflow, from database design and a RESTful API to a modern React front-end and sophisticated AI model integration.

***

### ‚ú® Key Features

* **Hybrid Recommendation Engine:** Provides personalized product recommendations by combining three methods:
    * **User-Based Collaborative Filtering:** Recommends products based on the viewing habits of similar users.
    * **Content-Based Filtering:** Recommends products based on their similarity to items a user has viewed (using product descriptions and categories).
    * **Popularity Fallback:** Recommends the most popular products for new users with no interaction history.
* **Secure Authentication:** Implements a robust and stateless authentication system using **JSON Web Tokens (JWT)**.
* **Admin Panel:** A dedicated dashboard for administrators to securely manage the product catalog (add, update, delete products).
* **Dynamic Front-End:** A responsive and modular Single-Page Application (SPA) built with **React.js**.
* **Product Search:** Allows users to search for products by keyword across names, descriptions, and categories.
* **Database Management:** Uses MySQL with foreign key constraints (`ON DELETE CASCADE`) for data integrity.
